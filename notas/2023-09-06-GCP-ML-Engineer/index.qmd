Key phases of Machine Learning project

1. Extract, transform, and load data into BigQuery
2. Select and preprocess featres
  * BigQuery ML does some preprocessing for us, like **one-hot encoding**
3. Create the model

```
#standarSQL

CREATE MODEL
ecommerce.classification

OPTIONS
(
  model_type='logistic_reg'
  input_label_cols='will_buy_later'

) AS 

# SQL with training data

```

There are others algorithms :

4. Evaluate the performance of the trained model



```
SELECT 
  roc_auc,
  accuracy,
  precision,
  recall
FROM 
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL`ecommerce.classification`)
```




5. Use the model to make predictions


```
SELECT * FROM
  ML.PREDICT
  (
    MODEL.`ecommerce.classification` )
```

#### Vertex AI

Vertex AI provides an end-to-end ML, pipeline to prepare data, and create, deploy, and manage models over time, and at scale.

We can think of Vertex AI Workbench as a Jupyter notebook deployed in a single development environment


#### Auto ML

Automate the process to develop and deploy an ML model.

AutoML automates the pipeline from feature ngineering, to architecture search, to hyperparameter tuning, and to model ensembly


#### Custom Training

*Do-it-yourself* solution to build an ML project.

Which environment you want your ML training code to use.

  * pre-built container
  * custom container


Can use ML Library (_TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and PyTorch._) collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform machine learning tasks.

TensorFlow


#### Lab Natural Language API

### AI Development Workflow

#### How a machine learns

There are several types of **Neural Networks** that solves different problems

* ANN *artificial neural network*
* DNN *deep neural network*
* CNN *convolutional neural network*
* RNN *recurrent neural network*
* LLM *large language models*


STEP 1 : calculate the weighted sum _multiplying each input value by its corresponding weight, and then summing the products_

<!--![Step 1](img/how_nn_works_1.png)-->

STEP 2: apply an activation function to the weighted sum.


<!--![STEP 2](img/how_nn_works_2.png)-->


STEP 3 :  the weighted sum is calculated for the output layer

STEP 4 :  apply an activation function to the weighted sum

<!--![Result](img/how_nn_works_3.png)-->

STEP 5 : calculate the cost function to minimize the difference.

<!--![STEP 5](img/how_nn_works_5.png)-->


Cost functions for :
* regression _(MSE)_
* classfication _(Cross-entropy)_


STEP 6: backpropagation

 *if the difference between the predicted and actual results is significant, you must go back to adjust weights and biases to minimize the cost function.*

<!--![STEP 6](img/how_nn_works_6.png)-->


STEP 7: Interate the process (epoch)

<!--![STEP 7](img/how_nn_works_7.png)-->


* we can set the number of epochs as a hyperparameter in training
* we can tell that the cost function has reached its optimum when the value stops decreasing, even after many iterations.

> This is how a neural network learns : It iterates the learning by continuously adjusting weights to improve behavior until it reaches the best result.


##### What is an activation function ? 

>  activation function is used to prevent linearity or add non-linearity.

* ReLU
* Sigmoid : binary classfication
* Softmax : multi-class classification
* TanH
* etc ...




#### ML workflow

Stages :

1. Data preparation  (Upload data and  Feature engineer) 
2. Model development 
3. Model serving 


#### Data preparation

During this stage, you must upload data and then prepare it for model training with feature engineering.


* feature engineering: the data must be processed before the model starts training.
* Vertex AI provides a function called Vertex AI Feature Store, which is a centralized repository to organize, store, and serve features.



#### Model development 

After data is ready it is time to training the model, this stage involves two iterative steps : 

1. Model training
2. Model evaluation


Vertex AI provides extensive evaluation metrics to help determine a model’s performance. A confusion matrix is a specific performance measurement for machine learning classification problems.

<!--![Confusion Matrix](img/confusion_matrix.png)-->


**Recall** : refers to all the positive cases, and looks at how many were predicted correctly.
**Precision** : refers to all the cases predicted as positive, and how many are actually positive.

![](img/precision_recall_confusion_matrix.png)


#### Model serving

On this stage we have two steps : 

1. Deploy model
2. Monitor the model

There are 3 options to deploy a model

1. Endpoint
2. Batch prediction
3. Offline prediction


To monitor there are a toolkit **Vertex AI Pipelines**




####  MLOps and workflow automation

> MLOps means automating and monitoring each step of the ML system construction to enable continuous integration, training, and delivery.

* MLOps on Vertex AI is a tool kit called Vertex AI Pipelines that supports : 
  * Kubeflow Pipelines, or KFP, and 
  * TensorFlow Extended, or TFX.






### Generative AI

Generative AI aims to solve general problems trained with amount of multimodal data.

Behind it we have LLMs *(Large Language Models)* , the revolution starts in 2017 when **Transformers** was invented by Google Researchers.

#### What are _Large Language Models_ ?

  Refer to **large**, **general-purpose** language models can be **pre-trained** and then **fine-tuned** for specific purpose

* Large : 
  * Large training dataset *PetaBytes*
  * Large number of parameters *trillions*

* LLM are trained to solve : 
  * Text classification
  * Question answering
  * Document summarization
  * Text generation
