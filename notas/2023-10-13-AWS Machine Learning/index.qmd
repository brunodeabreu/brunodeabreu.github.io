# AWS Machine Learning – Specialty


<!--## Intro do python--> 

## Intro do Machine Learning Concepts 

> ML Definition : A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P**, if its performance at ask in **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**

ML apply to many business use cases : 

*Industry :* 
  * Recomendation 
  * Demand forecast
  * Computer Vision
  * Fraud Detection
  * Medical Diagosis
  * Stock Market Forecasting
  * Sentiment Analysis

*Types:*
  * Supervised : classification and regression
  * Unsupervised : clustering, anomaly detection, association discovery


*ML Algorithms*
  * Logistic Regression : Binary classification
  * Decision Trees
  * Naive Bayes : Probability based



## Domain


**Domain 1** : Data Engineering *create repo, data-ingestion, data-transformation*
**Domain 2** : Exploratory Data Analysis *prep data for modelin, feature engineering, and data viz for ML*
**Domain 3** : Modeling *frame business problem as ML problems, select model, train ML, perform hyperparamter optimization, evaluate model*
**Domain 4** : ML Implementation and Operations *build and deploy ML solutions*
